A platform independant MySQL client with UI, slow query monitoring and processlist performance monitoring. The idea of the project was to create a cross-platform MySQL client using electron to be used locally on the MySQL server and provide a way to:
* Query the Database 
* Use explain to automatically catch any system crippling queries
* Monitor running queries
* Monitor the MySQL process's resource usage
* Watch slow query tables and extract and generalise the variables of the worst offenders
